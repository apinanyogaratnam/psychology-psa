However, that isn\'t always the case. There are many causes to homelessness such as poor care support systems, personal experiences, domestic violence, etc. ","2":"According to addictioncenter.com, 33% of homeless people are battling mental illness issues. Mental illness is a cause of homelessness in many parts of the world.","3":"One of the most unstable systems in Toronto is the low-income housing ratio. There has been a shortage of affordable housing due to the increase in house prices. This can lead to poverty for low-income families ending them becoming homeless. As overpopulation is currently a global issue, unemployment has increased as well. This makes it more difficult for certain people to find jobs. Another major cause to homelessness is domestic violence. This relates to mental health issues as it domestic violence leads to poor mental health and trauma especially to women. After an interview with 28 women, most of the women felt there wasn\'t enough support available to address the support needed. These are only a few of the major problems in society leading to homelessness.","4":"Most homeless people were once people like you and I who had jobs, lived with family, and had a home. People don\u2019t realize that people can become homeless overnight. Although, it may be true that some people are homeless due to them facing addictions with drugs and alcohol, a small percentage of homeless people are actually facing that problem. Homlessness corresponds to traumatization. This includes family abuse, foster care, youth pregnancy, mental illness, etc. Causes of immigration as well as low income families can become homeless due to the difficulty of getting a job without a computer, clothes to be presentable during the interview, a phone, and a fixed address. This makes it difficult for homeless people to get a job.","resources":["Suzanne Reynolds, The Complex Issues of the Perinatal Woman Experiencing Homelessness, Complex Social Issues and the Perinatal Woman, 10.1007/978-3-030-58085-8, (75-105), (2021)","Tischler, V., Rademeyer, A., & Vostanis, P.
