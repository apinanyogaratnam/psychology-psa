    "1": "It has been a common stereotype that all homeless people are drug addicts and alcoholics. However, that isn't always the case. There are many causes to homelessness such as poor care support systems, personal experiences, domestic violence, etc. (McChesney, 1990).",
    "2": "Most homeless people were once people like you and I who had jobs, lived with family, and had a home (McChesney, 1990). People donâ€™t realize that anyone can become homeless overnight. Although, it may be true that some people are homeless due to them facing addictions with drugs and alcohol, only a small percentage of homeless people are actually facing that problem.",
    "3": "For the individuals who are facing these difficulties, drug addiction is used as a coping mechanism for them to deal with past trauma by concealing painful memories and emotions (Carver et al., 2020). For some, it is a habit they may have obtained over the years before becoming homeless, while for others it is a new phenomenon they may have encountered after becoming homeless.",
    "4": "Drug Addiction and High Alcohol intake makes some people homeless when they are unable to pay for utility bills because they spend their fortune buying drugs and alcohol (Homelessness and Drug Addiction, 2016). Some people also have zero credit scores where they cannot keep money in their banks, and cannot borrow money from banks, therefore, they find themselves in debt. With low credit scores, they cannot rent a house. Homeless people are not drug addicts because they want to be, but they resort to such measures to cope with their sorrows.",
    "5": "Homlessness corresponds to traumatization. This includes family abuse, foster care, youth pregnancy, mental illness, etc. (Tischler, 2007). Causes of immigration as well as low income families can become homeless due to the difficulty of getting a job without a computer, clothes to be presentable during the interview, a phone, and a fixed address. This makes it difficult for homeless people to get a job.",
    "6": "One of the most unstable systems in Toronto is the low-income housing ratio (Tischler, 2007). There has been a shortage of affordable housing due to the increase in house prices. This can lead to poverty for low-income families ending them becoming homeless. As overpopulation is currently a global issue, unemployment has increased as well. This makes it more difficult for certain people to find jobs. Another major cause to homelessness is domestic violence. This relates to mental health issues as it domestic violence leads to poor mental health and trauma especially to women. After an interview with 28 women, most of the women felt there wasn't enough support available to address the support needed. These are only a few of the major problems in society leading to homelessness.",
    "7": "As a result, when one is approached by a homeless person, it is easy to assume and make conclusions as to why they may smell or look a certain way (Griffith, 2020). In these situations, most individuals come to the conclusion of drugs or alcohol addiction when in reality there are many other factors that come into play with their appearances such as their horrid living conditions or lack of launder. In other cases, one may also assume that a homeless person with shaky hands, and inattentiveness may also mean that they are under the influence. However, this could be due to sleep deprivation which is one of the common health issues which is one of the most common health issues that individuals in the homeless community experience.",
    "8": "According to addictioncenter.com, 33% of homeless people are battling mental illness issues (Murray & Hampton, 2021). Mental illness is a cause of homelessness in many parts of the world.",
    "9": "Therefore, the next time you see a homeless person, think of the failing systems before judging them and if you can, lend them a helping hand!",
